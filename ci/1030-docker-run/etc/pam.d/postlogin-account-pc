# This file is autogenerated by pam-config. All manual
# changes will be overwritten!
#
# The pam-config configuration files can be used as template
# for an own PAM configuration not managed by pam-config:
#
# for i in account auth password session session-nonlogin; do \
#      rm -f common-$i; sed '/^#.*/d' common-$i-pc > common-$i; \
# done
# for i in account auth password session; do \
#      rm -f postlogin-$i; sed '/^#.*/d' postlogin-$i-pc > postlogin-$i; \
# done
#
# Afterwards common-{account, auth, password, session, session-nonlogin}
# and postlogin-{account, auth, password, session} can be
# adjusted. Never edit or delete common-*-pc or postlogin-*-pc files!
#
# WARNING: changes done by pam-config afterwards are not
# visible to the PAM stack anymore!
#
# WARNING: self managed PAM configuration files are not supported,
# will not see required adjustments by pam-config and can become
# insecure or break system functionality through system updates!
#
#
# Account-related modules common to all or login services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of the account modules that define
# the central access policy for use on the system.
